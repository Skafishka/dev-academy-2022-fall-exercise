## part of frontend 
- It was kept here to show the process before using it as a build file at the minified view;
- frontend was developed based on the React-App library;
- inside the main file App.js have added description comments;
- to run the frontend separately it is needed to install the ReactJS and run it in the core frontend directory:
```
npm install react react-dom
npm start
```
- the frontend itself fetches data from data provided by the backend from 4 sets: 3 months (May, June and July) and Stations;
- It gives the statistics for every station, it allows to search the stations and journeys and to add new stations to the database.
